      "message": "Actually, some blocked threads in a specific thread pool could be more important for the overall healthiness of Gerrit.\n\nExample:\nGerrit is running 100 threads, but 20 of them are the SSH thread pool. All the SSH threads are blocked but they are only 20% of the total, so the healthcheck does not fire.\n\nWhat about adding a prefix for the threads so that the check is going to consider only those?\n\nFor instnace if prefix is \"SSH-Interactive-Worker\", then if 50% of the threads in that pool are blocked, then the overall instance is flagged as unhealthy.",
